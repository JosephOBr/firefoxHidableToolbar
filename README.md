# Autohide floating toolbar

This code works with MrOtherGuy's "userChrome.js manager" to hide the firefox toolbar. I made this to reduce the space used on the page so that you can save on screen-realestate when using firefox.




## Installation

1. follow the instructions on userChrome.org to enable userChrome.css:
https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html

2. follow the installation instructions of the readme of MrOtherGuy's userChrome.js manager:
https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig

3. Use the floatingNavbar.css and the floatingNavBar.uc.js files in the CSS and JS folders respectively
